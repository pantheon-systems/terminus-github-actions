# Terminus GitHub Actions

A GitHub Action for quickly installing and configuring the Pantheon CLI tool,
[Terminus](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus).

## Usage

In order to avoid deprecation warnings, it's recommended to use the
[`setup-php`](https://github.com/shivammathur/setup-php) action rather than rely
on the version of PHP that is installed by default on GH runners.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Setup PHP
    uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
    with:
      php-version: "7.4"

  - name: Install Terminus
    uses: pantheon-systems/terminus-github-actions@v1
    with:
      pantheon-machine-token: ${{ secrets.PANTHEON_MACHINE_TOKEN }}

  - name: List sites
    run: terminus site:list
```

By default, this action installs the latest version of Terminus that has been
released on GitHub. You can provide a specific version of Terminus to install
using the `terminus-version` input:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Setup PHP
    uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
    with:
      php-version: "7.4"

  - name: Install Terminus
    uses: pantheon-systems/terminus-github-actions@v1
    with:
      pantheon-machine-token: ${{ secrets.PANTHEON_MACHINE_TOKEN }}
      terminus-version: 2.6.5

  - name: List sites
    run: terminus site:list
```

This action will encrypt and cache the Terminus session by default to be re-used across jobs in a workflow to reduce the number of authorizations. If you need to disable this for some reason, you can set the `disable-cache` option to `true`.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Install Terminus
    uses: pantheon-systems/terminus-github-actions@v1
    with:
      pantheon-machine-token: ${{ secrets.PANTHEON_MACHINE_TOKEN }}
      disable-cache: true
```

Please note that in order to run commands that require SSH (e.g. drush or wp-cli), you will need to setup a SSH key. There are plenty of options available in the [Github Actions Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions&query=ssh+key+). We recommend you to choose one of them and use them in your pipeline.
